Questions:
1. Both implementations (i.e. use every layer)? add as option
2. C++ source uses 2^n, but it says k^n in paper? Isn't k = 5?. Also is it in the correct place?
3. Why are colour examples not having colour maps in paper?
4. Clarification of tests mentioned in meeting earlier (with python version changes etc.)

Todo:
1. include parameter features (norm, low pass)
2. check output with examples
3. implement as class

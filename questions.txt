Questions:
1. Both implementations (i.e. use every layer)? add as OPTION
2. C++ source uses 2^n, but it says k^n in paper? Isn't k = 5?. Also is it in the correct place? - add note saying k = 2
discussion with authours meant k = 2. OPTION
4. Clarification of tests mentioned in meeting earlier (with python version changes etc.) - pytest? with pre done maps

Todo:
1. include parameter features (norm, low pass)
2. check output with examples
3. implement as class
